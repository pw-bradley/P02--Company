                          Bought a set of Sumitomo Encounter AT 31x10.5xR15 tires for my daughters Jeep TJ, replacing the old worn out Duratracs. Have been through two pretty good snow storms since then and have been impressed with their handling in wet pavement, slush, snow and ice conditions. Added bonus is they are quite quiet on dry pavement for an AT tire. Price for these was quite good as well.
